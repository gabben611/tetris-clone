# tetris-clone
A clone of tetris in Java, following the Tetris Guidelines as closely as possible

I first attempted making a Tetris clone on June 20th, 2025. I spent the entire day,
and much of the following day, and at the end of it, I ended up with basic 
functioning gameplay (pieces spawn randomly, you can move and rotate them, including
wall kicks, they're saved to the board upon hitting the bottom, and when a row fills
up it disappears, with the rows above it falling down).

While this was a very fun project, and I did learn a lot about object oriented design,
GUI development with Swing, and 2D game architecture, I feel like I've neglected to make
my code clean and readable. The more code I wrote, the more I got lost looking through it,
and the more I became aware of my bad practices. Additionally, for much of the game
mechanics, I was making guesses based on video of gameplay and quick google searches,
rather than having a cohesive plan.

So, I've decided to restart the clone from scratch. I believe doing so will help me write cleaner, 
more maintainable code while building on everything I learned from the original version. Itâ€™s also 
a great opportunity for me to become more comfortable using GitHub for version control and project 
organization.
